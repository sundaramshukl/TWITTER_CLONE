 -> make folder like model for database schema, cotroller for entry in database auth for authentication router for routing pages
 ->create .env folder to store the MONGO_URI for url of database connection and PORT for port to run in the browser;
 ->add connection to the database in the db->connectMongoDB file:
 ->export function form above file and put in the server file in app.listen and 
-> create uesr module to enter user data for signup and (check if user info is already exist or not)then use bcrypt for hash and generate json web tolken in a separate folder lib/utils/generateToken
